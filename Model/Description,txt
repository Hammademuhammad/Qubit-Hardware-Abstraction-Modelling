Qubit models in quantum computing represent the fundamental unit of quantum information, capable of existing in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Unlike classical bits, qubits can be entangled, allowing them to exhibit correlations that are not possible in classical systems. FPGA implementation of qubits aims to bridge the gap between classical hardware and quantum algorithms, providing a platform to simulate and test quantum behaviors. Using FPGAs, researchers can model quantum gates, superposition, and entanglement, enabling efficient prototyping and the study of quantum circuits. This approach facilitates practical experimentation and accelerates the development of quantum computing technologies.
